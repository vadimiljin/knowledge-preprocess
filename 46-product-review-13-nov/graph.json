If you look at custom location in our database, we have two or three huge problems at the custom location level. Service time at the location level, but service time should be at the level of service type and location. The second problem is the incorrect assumption that at the level of one location there is only one service type. Because here there can be delivery, service, inspection, and so on. And everything changes proportionally. Because if you made a route today, during planning, we have a fourth problem - destination type selection should happen intelligently. You have recurring schedule, but ours is wrong. Our recurring schedule is at the location level, but recurring schedule should be at location plus service time potentially. Then this service time dynamically changes by day of week. Ordered and actual also change dynamically, but we don't have support for this.",

You don't even need to redo distance matrix because it's cached. Only service time changes.
