Dan describes as \"shameful\" and \"nonsense\".  \n**Business Impact:** Reputation - Critical. Clients will feel deceived after sales demo. Revenue - Blocks enterprise adoption after Strategic Route Planner success. User Experience - Tool unusable for intended purpose.  \n**Impact Severity:** Critical  \n**Urgency:** IMMEDIATE (Dan leaving for Iron Mountain demo - doesn't want to demo broken tool)  \n**Assigned To:** Frontend Team, Semeyon S (coordination)  \n**Deadline:** Implicit - before clients start using Strategic Route Planner and expecting Assignment Board  \n**Emotion:** Angry, harsh - \"shameful\", \"nonsense\", \"impossible\"  \n**Emotional Context:** Dan's harshest criticism in entire meeting. Calling tool \"shameful\" and \"nonsense\" is extraordinarily strong language - indicates he sees this as borderline fraudulent (looks good in demo, completely broken in use). His statement about leaving for demo without wanting to show Assignment Board reveals acute embarrassment. This is about integrity - Dan won't demo features he knows are broken.  \n**Status:** Pending (urgent priority)  \n**Authority Level:** CEO_FINAL_DECISION\n\n**Organizational Implications:**\n- Assignment Board is demo-ware - built for sales, not actual use\n- This represents fundamental development philosophy problem - appearance over function\n- Dan's harsh reaction sends message that team cannot ship unusable features\n- Strategic Route Planner success will immediately expose Assignment Board problems (clients will want dispatch after planning)\n- This is organizational crisis - team built pretty but broken tool, Dan discovered during demo prep\n\n---\n\n## DECISION HIERARCHY & AUTHORITY ANALYSIS\n\n### Decision: Strategic Route Planner Top Priorities\n\n**Reference:** See structured.md DECISION block for formal details\n\n**Authority Analysis:**\n- **Authority Level:** CEO_FINAL_DECISION\n- **Decision Maker(s):** Dan Khasis (sole decision maker)\n- **Dan's Role:** Direct decision - unilateral priority setting\n- **Approval Status:** Approved by Dan (self-directed)",
