**Dan Khasis** [00:00:27 - 00:00:39]: Hello. Hello. Before we start. Igor, I... Hello. Ah, okay. I'll tell you later.

**Artur Moskalenko** [00:01:30 - 00:01:31]: Hello, my dear ones.

**Semeyon S.** [00:01:34 - 00:01:36]: Hello, grandma, grandpa.

**Artur Moskalenko** [00:01:38 - 00:02:49]: I somehow wanted to rewatch the demo, and the first thing I heard was your "hello, my dears". Wow. Immediately a positive note. Grandpa, tell me a story. So, well, we're recording, so the story is postponed. So, everyone stand down, I'm the joker here. Was. So what kind of joker are you? 25 percent maximum. 26 and a half. Wow. So, Vladislav. I was watching. You want to test with a winch, right? Along this shore. Anyone? I think worse than Vladislav testing, there's nothing here. Legacy, new driver, just trash. They're also throwing something at a fan in parallel, you know, the consistency is brown, you know? Chocolate? No. Yes, chocolate, melted chocolate, you take it like this into a bowl, melt it, and then onto the fan. Beautiful. Yes, as they say, hit the shit with a stick, and that's it, face in freckles. Yes.

**Dan Khasis** [00:02:52 - 00:02:55]: We sympathize. And we're developing this, by the way.

**Artur Moskalenko** [00:03:01 - 00:03:48]: Excuse me, I'm clarifying, what are you developing, the stick or the shit? The movement. We're developing ideal source code. Ideal. I don't know how they turn into stick and shit with you. Sergey won't let you lie. Parry, Seryozha. Guys, I think Scatterplot is too early. Well, we just praised you, and you say Scatterplot is too early. What kind of setup is this? Why radar? We don't have such data for it to display well. I think maybe finish with radar to display everything together. No, you need to show Scatterplot at a minimum to show how it will look when there's little data.

**Dan Khasis** [00:03:48 - 00:03:53]: Because we saw it beautiful, Vova drew it beautifully.

**Artur Moskalenko** [00:03:53 - 00:03:58]: And approximately the same beautiful it will be when there are 20-30-50 scenarios.

**Dan Khasis** [00:03:58 - 00:04:19]: And when a person has 2-3 scenarios, it's ugly there. And this also needs to be shown. Admit honestly, this time did you see that what Vova drew turned into 100% what Vova drew?

**Alex Shulga** [00:04:20 - 00:05:44]: Of course, I made you a button exactly as Vova drew. Oops! That's it, round is set. It doesn't quickly turn into what you drew. But through pain, with sweat and blood, but sooner or later it turns. Very slowly sometimes. Sometimes generally through tears and blood. But it still turns. Quite often. By the way, through tears and blood is not the worst path. There's another one. Vladislav, let's not. Sorry, I'm going into mode. Let me spend time usefully. Please tell me, do we have redirects to the account settings page? Because we split account settings into organization settings. And I seem to have seen a redirect somewhere, but I can't say specifically. Who can answer this question for me? I looked in classic. There, I think, you can go to territory. So, in classic. This is our former original, former legacy, right? Yes. Pages are just written there. And where can I see where our redirects themselves are? So I know they exist.

**Dan Khasis** [00:05:45 - 00:05:47]: Well, you'll find them in the code.
